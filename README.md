## How It Works

GraphQL Editor simplifies the process of creating and understanding schemas. 

It is achieved through allowing you to build the schemas using visual blocks, which represent nodes, and connect them to create a database schema. The editor then automatically converts these visual representations into code, enabling you to present your GraphQL schemas in an intuitive and visually appealing manner without needing to write code manually. Additionally, it uses AI to generate basic documentation for that code which drastically improves teamwork, especially between backend and frontend. You can also take advantage of the built-in text IDE, which includes GraphQL syntax validation.

<br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GraphQL-Editor parsing is based on underlying [Zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus) technology.

| Feature   | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Visual GraphQL Editing | build a schema using visual blocks for nodes and connect them to create relations - then watch the editor instantly translate that into code |
| Dual editor | click a node and it will be selected in the visual graph and scrolled to in the schema code; edit it either on the visual click-through editor or in the code - the choice is yours |
| utilization of the Monaco editor | built on Microsoft's Monaco Editor (the same technology that powers Visual Studio Code) this IDE offers advanced features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error checking - all specifically optimized for GraphQL |
| Automatically bound interfaces | when an interface is implemented on type fields, it is auto-added to the type; if it is already implemented, editing the interface alters all the existent nodes across the schema to ensure consistency |
| Autogenerated docs | automatically generates basic documentation for your code with the help of AI; you can also edit and style the documentation using Markdown |
| Easy versioning | comparing schema versions is made easy thanks to specialized node-sorting and an AST-based comparison which omits irrelevant changes like line numbers |
| Inclusion of MongoDB | each editor project comes with a free instance of a MongoDB database, providing you with a scalable and flexible NoSQL database right out of the box |

<br />

### GraphQLEditor Component Props

**GraphQLEditor**

| Property      | Type                                                  | Description                                                                            | Required | Default   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| schema        | `PassedSchema`                                        | the value of the schema that contains GraphQL code and libraries used by the editor; it's the main source of data for the editor | yes      |           |
| setSchema     | `(props: PassedSchema, isInvalid?: boolean) => void;` | a function called when the schema is set by the Editor; it can also check if the schema is valid | yes      |           |
| readonly      | `boolean`                                             | a function that locks the editor and makes it read-only, disabling any editing capabilities | no       | false     |
| diffSchemas   | `Record<string, string>`                              | a record of GraphQL schemas where each schema is represented by a key-value pair with `name` being the key and `shema` being the schema's value | no       |           |
| theme         | `EditorTheme`                                         | the current theme of the Editor - ie. colors, fonts, etc; allows customization within different themes | --       | MainTheme |
| onRouteChange | `(r: EditorRoutes) => void;`                          | a function that handles route-related changes; **DISCLAIMER**: remember not to bind it with `routeState` as that will cause a 'maximum depth exceeded' error | no       |     |
| onTreeChange  | `(tree: ParserTree) => void`                          | a function that can be called when there are changes in the GraphQL parser tree; it can be used to respond to changes in the schema | no       |           |
| placeholder   | `string`                                              | placeholder text displayed when the editor is empty (no schema is loaded or present)            | no       |           |

<br />

**PassedSchema**

| Property  | Type     | Description                    |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| code      | `string` | the GraphQL schema code itself; this is the main content of the schema being edited or viewed       |
| libraries | `string` (optional) |  external libraries used with the schema |
| source | `tree` / `code` / `outside` | indicates the origin of the schema change: <br /> - `tree` - means changes originated from the visual tree editor <br /> - `code` - means changes originated from manual code edits <br /> - `outside` -  indicates external updates (e.g., imported or loaded from outside the editor) | 
| `passGraphValidation` | `boolean` | indicates whether the schema passes GraphQL validation; if set to true, it means the current schema is valid


<br />

**ActivePane**

This property controls which specific view is active within the GraphQL editor's sidebar. The available options are:

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
| `relation` | opens the main view that visualizes the relationships between nodes within the schema and enables working on it |
| `docs` | displays the autogenerated schema documentation which provides descriptions of the types and fields; it can also be edited using Markdown |
| `diff` | compares different versions of the schema, highlighting the differences between them |

<br />

## GRAPHQL GQL EDITOR

The GraphQLGqlEditor component provides a flexible editor for managing both a GraphQL schema and individual GraphQL queries or mutations. It has an optional read-only mode for presentations, custom themes and is fully customizable.

### Usage

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { GraphQLEditor, PassedSchema } from 'graphql-editor';

const schema = `
type Query{
	pizzas: [Pizza!]
}
`;

export const App = () => {
  const [gql, setGql] = useState('');
  return ( ||
    <div
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        alignSelf: 'stretch',

### Embedded GraphQL Editor

The Embedded GraphQL Editor is designed for embedding a read-only view of a GraphQL schema into your application. This is ideal for cases where you don't want any schema modification, but instead, just want to display it along with error highlights and schema navigation features.

### Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { EmbeddedGraphQLEditor } from 'graphql-editor';
import * as schemas from '../schema';

export const embeddedEditor = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        alignSelf: 'stretch',
        display: 'flex',
        position: 'relative',
      }}
    >
      <EmbeddedGraphQLEditor
        schema={{
          code: schemas.googleDirectionsNew,
          libraries: '',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

<br />
